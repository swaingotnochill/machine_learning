# Multivariate Regression

A typical supervised learning task, with labled training examples. It is also a typical 
regression task, more specifically a multiple regression as the system will use multiple 
features. It is univariate regression, as we are only trying to predict a single value.

There is no continous flow of data coming to system, there is no particular need to adjust
to changing data rapidly, and the data is small enough to fit in memory, so plain batch
learning will be used. 

Note- The data set is California Housing (1990). The dataset is old because this is my 
first ml project and in accordance with book : Hands_on_ML
